# Pexton's Pizzeria

A simple pizza ordering app I made to get familiar with the new React Hooks API
as well as Typescript.

Check out the app here [https://naughty-ardinghelli-a2ea9a.netlify.com/](https://naughty-ardinghelli-a2ea9a.netlify.com/)

FYI: I am not a graphic designer and have a preschool skill level in drawing
SVGs, so don't judge the pizza and toppings too harshly. :)
